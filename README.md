# Vapor-Liquid Equilibrium of THF-Water Binary System
### Objective
1) Construct T-x-y diagrams for the THF-water binary system at 1 atm using the Wilson model for non-ideal liquid and ideal vapor.
2) Compare simulated x-y data for THF with literature values at 1 atm.
3) Construct P-x-y and x-y diagrams for THF at 50°C.

### Methodology
1) T-x-y Diagram Construction: Utilize Wilson model and MATLAB to plot T-x-y diagrams, calculating activity coefficients using Wilson equations and vapor pressures using Antoine’s equation.
2) Comparison with Literature: Simulate x-y data for THF and plot alongside literature values for comparison.
3) P-x-y and x-y Diagrams at 50°C: Use Antoine’s equation and Wilson parameters to plot P-x-y and x-y diagrams in MATLAB.

### Results
1) Successfully constructed T-x-y, P-x-y, and x-y diagrams for THF-water system.
2) Observed close agreement between simulated and literature x-y data for THF.
3) Provided insights into the vapor-liquid equilibrium behavior at various temperatures and pressures.
